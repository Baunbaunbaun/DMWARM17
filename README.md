# DMWARM17
The files are my answers to the DMWARM17 problems: Pathfinder and 7 Segment Display.

A(Main)
In the Pathfinder problem the solution needed to be able to show the way through a maze of #'s, e.g. size 40x70 char's, and we should plot the solution as *'s through the maze - from top left corner to the low right corner. 
The algorithmic a approach I chose was pac man style â€“ Fill up the whole maze with *'s and let the algorithm eat everyone with only one neighbour. This removes all the dead-ends.  

B(Main2)
In the 7 Segment Display I just implemented simple pattern matching.
